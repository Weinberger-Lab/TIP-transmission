RAW DATA FOR TRAINING MODEL:
Data table is in pooled_donor_recip corrected 2.csv. If you rename this file, you must also rename it in 'mcmc_fit_CtrlTIPdonor_recip_fixpi_setRecipVTIP0_delayTIPtreatment.py' for the function to work. 
Column details:
- 'day' corresponds to day post exposure/infection, NOT day post source exposure/infection.
- 'hamster_id' goes from 1-5
- 'log10_pfu' is the log10 plaque forming units.
   Note the data is left-censored (minimum log10(500) due to experimental design)
- 'cens' takes on values of 0/1 as to whether the data is censored (0=Not Censored, 1=Censored).
- 'group' takes on values of 1/2 as to whether the data is from source or contact (1=Source, 2=Contact)
- 'treat' is 'ctrl' or 'TIP'

DEPDENCIES
MCMC fitting and analysis was done in python 3.8.2 with the following packages:
- pandas (1.3.4)
- matplotlib (3.5.0)
- numba (0.54.1)
- numpy (1.20.3)
- scipy (1.7.3)
- pymcmcstat (1.9.1)
- seaborn (0.11.2)

FITTING THE MODEL
- Running 'mcmc_fit_CtrlTIPdonor_recip.py' will re-plot the results for source-CTRL, contact-CTRL, and contact-TIP. New plots will be in the '20220105_24...' folder
- At the bottom of the file is where you can comment/uncomment items to re-fit models and choose other datasets (e.g. source-TIP). See the python file for more details.

ACTUAL OUTPUTS
20220105_24 has fitting results from source-CTRL, contact-CTRL, contact-TIP.
20220105_24b has fitting results from source-TIP.
(I had to re-simulate the process for source-TIP.)
